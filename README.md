# Human-vitals-monitoring-and-alert-system-using-IoT-analytics-platform
As a part of this project I developed an IoT-based human vitals monitoring alert system that continuously monitors human vitals and sends immediate notifications to smartphones in case of emergencies. The system detects if a person’s temperature exceeds 100°C and triggers a notification to the user.The project has significant potential for everyday use, providing timely alerts for critical health conditions
